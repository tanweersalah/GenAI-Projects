My recent projects include multiple innovative applications of Generative AI, leveraging LangChain and open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) to address diverse use cases.    SKILLS  Generative AI: Open Source LLMs, OpenAI LLM, LangChain, LangChain Agents, LangChain Tool, LLamaIndex, RAG, Vector Database, GraphDB Machine Learning: TensorFlow, TensorFlow Lite Back-End: Python, FastAPI, Java Spring Boot, .Net Core, C#, Java, Rest API, JSON Front-End: JavaScript, Typescript, Vue.js, React.js, Streamlit, HTML5, CSS3, Adobe XD, Figma Database: GraphDB, PostgreSQL , SQL, Azure Storage Services Tools & Methods: Azure, Docker, Git, GitHub, Azure DevOps, CI/CD,  OS: Linux, Mac, Windows Professional: Jira, Confluence, Remote Pair-Programming, Teamwork Soft Skills : Collaboration, Productivity, Creativity, Continuous Learning, Problem Solving, Agile Methodology, Documentation, Communication skills  PROJECTS TanGPT - Demo • A ChatGPT clone built using open-source large language models, LangChain, FastAPI, and Vue.js. The project is deployed with Docker and uses Nginx for proxy management. YouTube Video and Webpage Summarizer - Demo • A generative AI application that utilizes open-source large language models to summarize lengthy videos and web pages using the MapReduce method. The application is deployed on Streamlit. TanSeo (SEO optimizer App) - Demo • A content generation project that produces SEO-optimized web page content using open-source large language models and a series of SEO-specific prompts. Translator App- Demo • A translation application capable of translating multiple languages, built with open-source large language models. Movie review sentiment analysis App- Demo • A sentiment analysis application that uses three different models (ANN, RNN, and LSTM) trained on IMDB datasets to analyse movie reviews. TanFlix  • A Netflix clone with movie recommendation system, trained on The Movie Database (TMDB) Facial Expressions Detection • Facial Expression Recognition using YOLOv5 and RepVGG (CNN)  • • Skills: Python, TensorFlow, NumPy, OpenCV (CV2), Pandas, Seaborn, TensorFlow Developed an IoT-based Vehicle Accident Detector • Implemented shock and gyro sensors to accurately detect accidents, ensuring real-time monitoring and response. • Emergency Notification System: Designed and integrated an Android app to send immediate emergency notifications to the driver's contacts, enhancing safety and response times. Pneumonia type detection from X-Ray scans using Deep CNNs • CNN was used for classifying Viral pneumonia into COVID/MERS/SARS. • ResNet50 architecture was implemented to classify Bacterial pneumonia from normal chest X-Ray scans and achieved 94% training accuracy & 94% validation accuracy. \"),\n",
