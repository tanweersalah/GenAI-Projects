However, the scholar in the video does mention that one can make dua in their native language, and that Allah will respond to the dua made with positivity and good intentions.\\n\\nThe scholar also mentions that the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said that the closest a servant of Allah is to Allah is when he\\'s in sujud (prostration), and that one can choose whatever dua they want to make in that state.\\n\\nIf you\\'re looking for some general guidance on making dua, here are a few points:\\n\\n* Make dua with sincerity and humility\\n* Be positive and have good intentions\\n* Make dua in a state of cleanliness and purity\\n* Face the Qibla (direction of the Kaaba) when making dua\\n* Raise your hands when making dua\\n* Be patient and persistent in your dua\\n\\nAs for some general duas that are commonly made, here are a few examples:\\n\\n* \"Oh Allah, forgive me and have mercy on me\" (Allahumma ighfir li wa rahmuk)\\n* \"Oh Allah, guide me and grant me wisdom\" (Allahumma ihdini wa ajirni)\\n* \"Oh Allah, grant me good health and well-being\" (Allahumma atina fi ad-dunya hasanah wa fil-akhirati hasanah)\\n* \"Oh Allah, protect me from harm and evil\" (Allahumma a\\'udhu bika min sharri nafsi wa min sharri kulli dhi sharrin)\\n\\nRemember, the most important thing is to make dua with sincerity and faith, and to trust in Allah\\'s wisdom and mercy.'"
